Currently, we combine these species models to create the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) which represents the degree to which species have been impacted due to changes in landcover. However, determining which species should be included within each reporting region has been challenging. This bookdown document evaluates two methods for filtering species lists and identifies which method will be adopted. 1.1 Caveats This approach is useful for determining species lists for auto-generated reporting regions. However, we recommend that species lists are manually reviewed to insure their accuracy whenever possible. 1.2 Suggested citation Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute. 2023.

"],["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Maximum Abundance Threshold 2.2 Ratio Threshold 2.3 Method Comparison", " 2 Methods 2.1 Maximum Abundance Threshold To determine if a species should be reported on in a focal region, we calculate the mean abundance of the species and compare it to 1% of the maximum provincial abundance. \\(mean(RegionalAbundance) &gt; [max(ProvincialAbundance) * 0.01]\\) If the species is predicted to occur in the region under either current or reference conditions, we include it in our summary. This approach can be applied to all regions, irrespective of region size, and identifies areas where the species is reasonably abundant. However, we have identified situations where this approach either includes or excludes species from a region that differs from expert opinion. Some of the reasons that this occurs are: If we have outlier predictions, the maximum abundance may become so large that mean abundance is unlikely to ever be greater than the defined threshold. If a species has a high probability of occurrence within a small portion of a large focal region, the mean abundance may be higher than the defined threshold. This species would occur in the region, but is of low relevance for management and reporting purposes. 2.2 Ratio Threshold One alternative approach is to filter species by comparing the mean abundance within the focal region to the mean abundance across the province.. \\(mean(RegionalAbundance) &gt; mean(ProvincialAbundance)\\) If the species is predicted to occur in the region under either current or reference conditions, we include it in our summary. This approach can be applied to all regions, irrespective of region size, and identifies areas where the mean abundance for the species within the focal region is greater than or equal to the mean abundance across the province. However, this thresholding approach is likely to be highly restrictive. Therefore, we explored adjusting the provincial mean abundance by different modifiers (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%). \\(mean(RegionalAbundance) &gt; [mean(ProvincialAbundance) * 1]\\) \\(mean(RegionalAbundance) &gt; [mean(ProvincialAbundance) * 0.75]\\) \\(mean(RegionalAbundance) &gt; [mean(ProvincialAbundance) * 0.5]\\) \\(mean(RegionalAbundance) &gt; [mean(ProvincialAbundance) * 0.25]\\) In both methods, we ignore pixels that do not have predictions within the reporting region due to many species not having full provincial models. 2.3 Method Comparison As the ABMI is constantly reporting on new regions of interest, we assessed the utility of these methods using simulated regions of different spatial sizes (25 km^2, 100 km^2, 1000 km2, 10,000 km^2, 100,000 km^2). In some instances, simulated regions did not result in complete spatial coverage. These missing areas are represented using white or grey. In addition, we determined the species list for the Oilsands Monitoring Region (Figure 1) based on each filtering approach. By using an area of the province we consistently report on, we can determine which filtering approach best matches our expert opinions. We ran this analysis using the bird, mammal, and vascular plant coefficients (version 2022) and the 2018 Human Footprint Inventory. These taxonomic groups were chosen as we have a good ecological understanding for how these species are spatially distributed across Alberta. Due to the number of species evaluated, we are only presenting a subset of results in this document. ABMI staff can access the full set of results by contacting the maintainer of this repository. Figure 1 - Boundary of the Oilsands Monitoring Region. "],["results.html", "3 Results", " 3 Results Overall, the Maximum Abundance Threshold approach identified the least restrictive species ranges. While the Ratio Threshold with the 100% modifier resulted in the most restrictive species ranges (Figures 2-4). This was irrespective of the size of the focal region. In the Oilsands Monitoring Region, the Maximum Abundance Threshold approach identified 534 species followed by the Ratio Threshold at 25% (477), 50% (401), 75% (336), and 100% (241). Some notable species that were included in the Maximum Abundance Threshold but none of the Ratio Threshold approaches were Barn Swallow, Pronghorn, Savannah Sparrow, and Downy Chess (Bromus tectorum). Figure 2 - Abundance, simulated regions (1,000 km2), mean threshold, and ratio thresholds for Blue Jays under both current and reference conditions. Red/Orange indicate high abundance and sites where the threshold indicated the species should be reported on. Figure 3 - Abundance, simulated regions (1,000 km2), mean threshold, and ratio thresholds for Pronghorn under both current and reference conditions. Red/Orange indicate high abundance and sites where the threshold indicated the species should be reported on. Figure 4 - Abundance, simulated regions (1,000 km2), mean threshold, and ratio thresholds for Red Baneberry (Actaea rubra) under both current and reference conditions. Red/Orange indicate high abundance and sites where the threshold indicated the species should be reported on. "],["outcomes.html", "4 Outcomes", " 4 Outcomes Based on this analysis, the ABMI Science Centre has decided to move forward with the following method for filtering species lists: We will adopt the Ratio Threshold inclusion criteria using a modifier of 25%. Though this approach does not guarantee a completely accurate species list, it is a better approach compared to the Maximum Abundance Threshold method. The 25% threshold was not the best method for several species of mammals. Therefore, the thresholds for those species were manually reviewed to improve accuracy. This lookup table can be found in the GitHub repository (data/lookup/thresholding-lookup.xlsx). Species who meet the inclusion criteria under either current or reference predicted abundance will be included. This will properly capture both species who have increased or decreased in abudnance within the region. When calculating the mean abundance for either the province or focal region, NA values are ignored. This approach is useful for determining species lists for auto-generated reporting regions. However, we recommend that species lists are manually reviewed by those with expert knowledge to insure their accuracy whenever possible. The adopted methods will be reviewed when substantial changes to the underlying species distribution models are made in order to insure accuracy.
