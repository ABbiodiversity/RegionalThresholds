# Methods for filtering species lists for regional reporting

## Overview

The ABMI has developed ~1000 unique species distribution models that can be used to inform land-use management decisions. Currently, we combine these species models to create the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) which represents the degree to which species have been impacted due to changes in landcover. However, determining which species should be included within each reporting region has been challenging. This document will outline the current method for filtering species and explore alternative methods that could be adopted for reporting initiatives.
