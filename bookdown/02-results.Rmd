Overall, the **Maximum Abundance Threshold** approach identified the least restrictive species ranges. While the **Ratio Threshold** with the 100% modifier resulted in the most restrictive species ranges (Figures 2-4). This was irrespective of the size of the focal region.

In the Oilsands Monitoring Region, the **Maximum Abundance Threshold** approach identified 534 species followed by the **Ratio Threshold** at 25% (477), 50% (401), 75% (336), and 100% (241). Some notable species that were included in the **Maximum Abundance Threshold** but none of the **Ratio Threshold** approaches were Barn Swallow, Pronghorn, Savannah Sparrow, and Downy Chess (*Bromus tectorum*).
