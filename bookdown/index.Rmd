# Overview

The ABMI has developed ~1000 unique species distribution models that can be used to inform land-use management decisions. Currently, we combine these species models to create the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) which represents the degree to which species have been impacted due to changes in landcover. However, determining which species should be included within each reporting region has been challenging. This **bookdown** document evaluates two methods for filtering species lists and identifies which method will be adopted.

## Caveats

This approach is useful for determining species lists for auto-generated reporting regions. However, we recommend that species lists are manually reviewed to insure their accuracy whenever possible.
